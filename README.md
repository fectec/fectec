# 👋 Welcome, my name is Juan!

<p align="justify">I'm a developer with an interest in <strong>Embedded Systems</strong> and <strong>Robotics</strong>. I'm currently pursuing a <i>B.S. in Robotics and Digital Systems Engineering</i>.</p>

<p align="justify">I like to think of myself as a full-on nerd, totally captivated by cool, nerdy things—especially COMPUTERS! 💻 (Seriously, humanity really outdid itself with that).</p>

</p>

<p align="justify">I tend to fall down rabbit holes, constantly chasing the "how" 🔍 behind everything, which is exactly why I find building robots 🤖 so much fun. I’d love to nerd out with you and collaborate on some coding projects! Feel free to email me at <a href="mailto:fectec151@gmail.com">fectec151@gmail.com</a> 😄</p>
