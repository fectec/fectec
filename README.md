# 👋 Hi, my name is Juan!

<p align="justify">Welcome! I'm a developer with interest in <strong>Embedded Systems</strong> and <strong>Robotics</strong>. I'm currently pursuing a <i>B.S. in Robotics and Digital Systems Engineering</i>.</p>

<p align="justify">I like to think of myself as a full-on nerd, totally captivated by cool, nerdy things—especially COMPUTERS! (Seriously, humanity really outdid itself with that).</p>

</p>

<p align="justify">I tend to fall down rabbit holes, constantly chasing the "how" behind everything, which is exactly why I find building robots so much fun. I’d love to nerd out with you and collaborate on some coding projects! Feel free to email me at fectec151@gmail.com 😄</p>
