<p align="justify">I like to think of myself as a full-on nerd, totally captivated by cool, nerdy things—especially <strong>COMPUTERS</strong>! 💻 (Seriously, humanity really outdid itself with that). I tend to fall down rabbit holes, constantly chasing the <i>"how"</i> 🔍 behind everything, which is exactly why I find building <strong>robots</strong> 🤖 so much fun. I’d love to nerd out with you and collaborate on some coding projects! Feel free to <strong>mail</strong> me at <a href="mailto:fectec151@gmail.com">fectec151@gmail.com</a> 😄</p>
