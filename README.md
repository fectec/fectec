<p align="justify">I tend to fall down rabbit holes, constantly chasing the <i>"how"</i> behind everything, which is exactly why I find building robots so much fun. Iâ€™d love to nerd out with you and collaborate on some coding projects! Feel free to <strong>mail</strong> me at <a href="mailto:fectec151@gmail.com">fectec151@gmail.com</a> ðŸ˜„</p>
